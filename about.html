                            Hello I'm Ryan. I've made this story in my free time to kill some time, but look at it now. It has grown from a small train project with actual nothingness to an actual group of 2 working on it with an <strong>actual bloody working</strong> website. But as it is still only 2 people who work in there free time, there are a lot of things wrong on this website, so please don't judge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Actual something about the story. It is a story about me, well atleast who I used to be, and my history in my perspective. Most things are fictional but an actual quite sum are real people I've met and encountered in my actual life. The only thing that would be differen is the way I'd meet them, their names and sometimes their looks (like hair color is quite modified). So please don't think these are all real and certainly don't ask about anyone because I will probably not answer. The people who want to be reconized (or want to reconize themselves) will do so on their own.
                            </p>
                        </div>




                        <h3 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">This site is Pasta</h3>
                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                            <p>
                                As you may have noticed, this website is pasta. By which I mean it is a real mess with all the pictures and text.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Wrongful text</h1>
                            <p>
                                If you see anything suspicious in text (like wrong spelling or sentences) message me via the <a href="contact.html"><strong>Contact</strong></a> page.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Disgusting photo's</h1>
                            <p>
                                As you see the photo's now, most of them are from the internet (like the one that is above all this text right now). For the pages and logo, you can't do really much. But for every chapter there is a book displayed as cover. I want to replace those with illustrations from <b>you</b>. That's why they haven't been replaced yet (except for a couple). So if you like a chapter and it doesn't have a cover. <a href="contact.html"><strong>Contact</strong></a> me and draw it for me, because everything here is appriciated and most will be accepted (if it is mature, admirible with passion and relevant). 
                            </p>
                            <h6>Thank you.</h6>
