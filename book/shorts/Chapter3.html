									“Here! Here they are!” I heard in the distant. I looked up and so did Megan. “So here you guys ran off to.” I heard Jenna say. I stood up and scratch the back off my head with a laugh “Haha yea, we were just…” Suddenly Jeff ran up to me and punched me in the stomach, “Don’t you dare try to laugh.” He said with a rough voice. I looked at the ground and tried to grasp for air whilst I heard Jenna say “Jack! What the hell!” “Oh don’t you go defending him. You were just as mad as me just a minute ago.” Jack tried justifying his punch whilst I was still hurting from it. Jenna walked up to Megan and stood in front of her trying to defend whatever Jack was going to do. I looked up, Cas tried to cool down Jack and Jeff just stood there looking at me how I was grasping for air with a disappointed face. I stood straight up and looked Jack in the eyes, he looked furious. “Hey man, I’m sorry” I tried talking but he didn’t seem to care much. “Don’t you dare to apologize. You don’t just run off of your friends. You just don’t Ryan!” I didn’t seem a problem in it, but that is just how I was, so I tried to make sense of the situation in my way. I tried to see it from their point of view, they must’ve been worried or wanted to know where we would go. So I tried explaining “He sorry guys, you could have phoned me if you were worried…” I got another hard punch in the face and fell down. “Worried!? Worried my ass! You just don’t run of when it suits you with your supposed ‘girl’.” I heard Jack say while I was drifting off because of the punch mixed in with the freezing feeling. “I’m sorry Jack.” “Shut your damn trap.” “I won’t do it again, I’ll properly…” “You won’t get a chance to do it again! You like running off so much. Go home! And don’t think about joining our campfire! Or anything anymore at that.” I laid on my back looking at the supposedly beautiful stars, then at the friends or whom I thought were when they all looked away. Even Megan, she was pulled away by Jenna down to the beach. Everyone followed and only Cas went up to me and said “I’m sorry dude.” After quite a while of processing what just happened I stood up. I still felt my face who had been punched. I went up to the cliff where Megan and I laid just a fraction ago before everything went into flames and looked at the campfire who they just got on fire. They looked so happy, even though just a minute ago they had a fight. Maybe it was just in my eyes, but it looked like this was natural and nothing had happened and this was just another fun night. Just, without me.</p>
								</p>
								<p>
								I decided not to try and disturb them and to confront them the next day. So I did. The next day I went up to the group like I would normally and tried to joke around. I got no comment but only ugly glares. Even Megan, the girl whom I put my heart into, even tried not to respond. I felt like everything holding me together was crumbling. I desperately tried everything, from making jokes to just trying to have a conversation. Whilst Cas was there for me in a mild way, just enough to know that I wasn’t alone, Jeff gave me the feeling he was waiting for make me the same level as the ground. Jack was just full on ignoring me and Jenna tried not to talk to me and just talk to Megan instead. But Megan was the worst of them all. She pretended like we didn’t do anything, she pretend I didn’t exist and just full on reacted to me like I was an annoying little kid. It hurt me from inside, but what was the worst was that on the end of the day she reacted to me once. I told her a stupid joke or something, I can’t even remember it anymore, and she reacted with a mad voice “You know what Ryan! You like me, right?” Like an innocent little puppy I replied “Yes?” “Well, I don’t like you.” On that moment my world shattered. Everything fell apart and no one who was there listening on us cared. We were on the bike, so on that moment I decided to distance me from everyone. I turned right when everyone turned left, just a couple of sand roads up ahead and there was a bench. I sat down and because most of my mind is about processing everything, I processed everything. Everything hit me harder than any punches from Jack, I just wanted to miser away right there on the bench. But it was late and my stomach began to rumble so I would like I’d normally do pick myself up, slap my face and straighten up my posture to go back to family. Nothing happened much afterwards just one miserable fail of me not wanting to let go of those fun times, but no one knew me other than Cas who had been out for a couple of days. So I decided to spent the next days on my own, just trying to mend my world back up again to the point of being sane.</p>
