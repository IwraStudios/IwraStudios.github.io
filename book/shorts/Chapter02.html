									Next days we would just have fun with everyone and the group, nothing really happened but everyone noticed something between us. So one day we were in the group showers, in which we were not nude FYI, they all left, supposedly meaning that I and Megan would share a kiss. All good and all but around that time I had no self-esteem and could only fake a little. So with all that I wasn’t able to lead let alone kiss her myself. So much of a scene it wouldn’t be. Too bad because it was the perfect setting. The showers were just right to cool down from the hotness outside and we had just been on the beach. The crickets were going at it and you could sometimes hear a bird chirp. The only thing missing was me having the nerves to so. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The night fell but the warmth was not escaping our atmosphere. We had nothing planned so we decided to go to the skate park near town after we got some crepes from the night festival. I walked together with Megan who had twisted her arm into mine like we were an elderly couple. I knew she just wanted to be lazy and slackely hang off my arm but we were happy and she smiled at me. It felt like the most beautiful place of all and both of us were happy. We sat upon the ramp looking at people skating, as well as our friend who couldn’t fully understand us, she laid on my lap and I petted her head from time to time. We were both enjoying how skaters were going up and down from the ramp and how we talked to our little group. I mostly was teasing Jeff about everything and sometimes maybe a little too far, although nobody said anything but rather laughed the night away. Around the time we would mostly go and make a campfire at the beach but I had the miraculous idea to take Megan by the arm, pull her up to my bike and sit her down. “Where are we going?” she asked with a smile laughing trying to hold her hair down because the wind was blowing it up. It was such a cute sound, like the innocence of a curious child. “Wait and you’ll see.” I said with a satisfying grin. We heard Jack and Jenny screaming where we were going but I chose to ignore it. After a little bike ride and lots of laughing at people and music we reached the beach and went up to a big rock I had discovered during daytime. I stopped and she stepped off, I dropped my bike and we went up to the great cliff hanging over the beach. There weren’t many people around so it was nice and quiet. I turned on some peaceful nice music and laid down. It was getting a little colder so I pulled of my jacket and swelled it around her “Thank you kind sir.” She said with a mocking smile to which I replied “Everything for m’lady” “Won’t you get a cold?” I sat on one arm, looked to her and said “Beauty need to be preserved.” She quickly bolled up and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I smiled and felt like the happiest man alive. For the next hour we would do nothing but gaze up into the sky whilst the sea would continue roar on.
