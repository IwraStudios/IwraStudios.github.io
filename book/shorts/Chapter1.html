									I had vacation and my parents decided to go to Italy. Not really a big deal but without Wi-Fi or any friends there would be little to do. Luckily for me there were some old friends I had met years ago on the same campsite we staid and as it would seem they were here to. We started to hang out quite often and they even had a small group to go with. Cas was the first one, a tall guy who was into movies, liked to be at ease and just chill and was always nice as he would be the guy I’d spend most time with. Second we had Jesse, a blond long dude which was actually Belgian but staid in France for a long while so he would be always our translator most off all really at ease to and was very nice to everyone. Third there was Jenna a girl who had iron fist for language but from the inside was a little insecure, she was quite powerful and strong mouthed but easily offended. Fourth there was Jeff who was the little brother of Cas, he was quite energetic and always full of life, jumped up everywhere and did anything a little brother would do. Fifth we had Jack he was the most powerful and very nice if you were his friend, it would be that he was a kick boxer and was better with his fists and not easy on the tong either. Sixth and rather last there was a I think French guy who dropped by most often, he was very nice and quite energetic, he wasn’t always there but he would always brighten up the place although he could understand everything we said.
								</p>
								<p>
									So our days would mostly consist of chilling with each other, beginning on the beach where we would swim and sometimes play cards. Afterwards we would chill somewhere in town or around town on the playgrounds playing ball or so. But at night campfires would be lit and we would look up into the stars just chilling with music and such. As it sounds now you would think this was my best vacation ever, but let me tell you why this was also the worst in my life.
								</p>
								<p>
									One day when I couldn’t come with to the beach I was still coming to hang out afterwards and it would seem that a new girl had joined our group. A brown hair coloured girl, slim and simple at mostly just beautifully minimalist. She was staggering in my eyes. We were hanging out in the middle of town where they had just held a small performance and would so again the next day. I sat down next to her and we began talking, “Hi, I’m Ryan” I introduced myself with a smile “I’m Megan” she replied looking a little down. “Whats up Megan?” I tried asking “Something bothering you?” She looked at her phone and said “Well my boyfriend is being mean again, we had a fight. Which is the third this day.” “Doesn’t sound a holding relationship.” “No, I think we’re going to break up.” We sat on the podium while looking at the stars. They shined as bright as paintings hanging in a museum. We chilled and talked about each other. After a while it was getting a little colder and without her even asking I gave her my jacket and smiled. She rapped the jacket around her shoulder and softly laid her head on my shoulder, “the stars are beautiful, aren’t they?” She asked with the softest voice, “Yea, shining so bright.” I replied and we both gazed up into the night sky, not saying another word until midnight just enjoying the quiet and peace of each other.
