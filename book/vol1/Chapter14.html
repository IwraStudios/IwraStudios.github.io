                                Melissa looked at me and to the girl in the other corner smiling with the laugh of a cat who just looked up from cleaning its paw. Everyone looked around and I immediately regained myself, closed my mouth and sat straight. Everyone turned around and the teacher said: “Continue, what is it clary?” to which she replied with a grin “Nothing sir continue.” He shook his head and continued with his class. I continuously looked at Clary which I thought would freak her out, but she seemed to giggle a little. Melissa tried, like any sane person would, to get some information about this weird situation she has been put in and asked: “Friend of yours? Oooh your girlfriend?” I blushed and turned around. “No!” I said firmly, “just someone I met.” Melissa’s face turned into a sneaky devilish look, “Oh I see.” She said, “you have a crush on her, don’t you Ryan?” I didn’t answer that question and just looked with a puffed face outside like someone asked a question that I didn’t like and couldn’t answer. Melissa giggled which made my face only worse.
                                </p>

                                The buzzer rang and we all got up. “Aaaaaah three hours of nonsense finally over.” Melissa said while stretching her arms out like she had just slept, which could be true because I wasn’t paying attention either. We both stepped out and saw Clary and a few guys standing in the hallway. Clary had a buzzed face and I had the feeling she didn’t really like the guys who were talking to her. “Come on Clary, one little date? I mean I do look amazing, don’t I?” The guy with blond hair in front of them all said, to which the guy next to him said: “Don’t be such a buzzkill Clary.” The other dude grabbed her hand, “Yea! Come hang with us. Maybe you’ll like one of us and real maybe even more” he said with the most perverted face I had seen in a while.
“Ugh those guys are bastards.” Melissa said, “the only thing they think about is disgusting.” I stepped up to the guys and my heart bounced out of my chest “What are you doing Ryan?” I heard Melissa say behind me. “St- st- t- t-.” I tried to speak, but words were merely a fainted dream for me. “What does this pip squeak want?” The side guy said, “Maybe he wants to play to” the other dude rambled out with a big laugh afterwards. I felt like I was trying to fight with kings of the jungle whilst being a little mouse, “Stop -p   i- i- -t guys.” The three fellows looked at me with a frown, then looked at Clary. They let out a great laughter all at the same time “What!? Is this your boyfriend or something!?” they said whilst tears came out “Who does he think he is!?” Clary grabbed my arm and pulled me towards her “Yes!” She screamed whilst holding me tightly, “He is my boyfriend!” They immediately stopped laughing and looked at me like they had seen something truly astounding. After a while they started laughing again and walked away, “if that is your taste Clary, then you must be pretty stupid.” They said whilst choking on their laughter. Clary looked down with a sad face “Well at least he was a gentlemen.” I stood there not knowing what exactly was going through her mind, but the she grabbed herself together again and said with a nice smile “Thanks Ryan, you saved me.” To which I replied “Not really, all I did was stutter.” “Not that, moreover that you were there for me when everyone else just passed me by. That is what saved me.” “I just saw you were in trouble, but could you maybe loosen up a little, you’re hurting my arm.” She was strangling my arm like trying to hold on to something. “Oh, yea, sorry.” Melissa came closer from her viewing point and looked at me “So Ryan? I thought you said she wasn’t your girlfriend?” I blushed and looked away, “She isn’t.” To which Clary cutted in “Well that is not nice to say, maybe after our first date you’ll change your mind.” And she winked at me with to most devilish smile there was.
