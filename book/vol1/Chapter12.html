                                 The first 22 massages were gibberish, not interesting at all. Some were from friends who tried contacting me to come online, I already spoke to them saying that my phone broke down. Others were either from my mom or my friend either asking how I was doing or saying what a wild night it was and that we should catch up, which is funny because either could be the one. The last 10 were from the girl I’ve not even met, but it looked like she was talking to me. She knew I did not receive her messages because of the handy functions on the messenger app, although knowing that it did not stop her from writing.

                                    I turned off my phone and stopped brushing my teeth which I had been doing to get ready for bed. I turned down the light, threw out the cat and went upstairs in bed. Next day would be the first day I’d see my whole class. It was exciting but scary.

                                I was on the bike driving to a farm which sold strawberries. I got a pack and paid the farmer his fee. Driving further down the road to a house which was located on the end of the street. I knocked on the door and a white blond girl opened smiling like a sunshine over a plain field in the morning. I gave her the pack of strawberries and she kindly accepted it and invited me in. Although I couldn’t hear anything because it was muffled like everyone was underwater. But when I walked inside everything went black. When I could see again I was walking down the road with her. She was smiling whilst carefully pulling of the crowns from the strawberries. She had the most energetic and joyful face I could’ve imagined and talked like every day was magnificent to her. But when she talked I couldn’t understand as everything was still muffled. I didn’t need to understand as that I was caught up in her eyes, nothing was real to them and they would only see beauty in people. She stopped and when I finally realized where we were she sat down on the white railing of the bridge. I sat down next to her and she looked up, she pointed at a blinking light in the night sky and said “That star over there, it shines so bright.” To which I replied “I think you shine even brighter.” She looked at me with a stunned face. I immediately looked away but I could feel her smiling back at me with great eyes. “Well that is only because” she said while tilting up my head back in her eyes “you are here with me.”
