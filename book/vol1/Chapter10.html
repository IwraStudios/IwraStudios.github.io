                                My home wasn’t far off, and our travel time wasn’t long. I opened the backyard door with my key and stepped inside. That door never wants to stay open and closes on itself because of the leaves pushing it back, so I held the door open for Mea. “Ah a real gentlemen I see.” I rolled my eyes but without the slightest feeling off annoyance. She ran inside with open arms straight to my cat and everything on the floor was wet. “Hey!” I yelled with concern for my stuff inside. “Who’s a cute kitty.” She said with a cute voice herself, “Miauw miauw.” Like she was trying to talk to the cat.
                                </p>
                            <p>
                                After a little while she stood up pointed at me and asked with a serious face “Where is your bathroom?” and then tilted her head and smiled. I stood there with confusion and I didn’t know what to say exactly, so I just pointed upstairs. I shook my head out of its confusing and said “U- upstairs, the toilet downstairs has a broken lock.” She retracted her arm and jumped up a little “Oh thank you.” And with that she ran upstairs. After the realization of what just happened I picked up my consciousness and started preparing dinner.
                                </p>
                            <p>
                               I opened the faucet and water started pouring into the big cooking pot. The tap seemed to give less water after a while, it seemed strange but I didn’t pay much attention to it. I turned up some music on the big boxes for background noise and started singing along. Cutting the onions, pounding some meat for the volume and making meatballs. I turned on the gas for the pan to lay on and turned up the heat. Poured in some tomato sauce, meatballs I made and fine spices. Whilst that was cooking I turned off the faucet when the pan was almost full and heard a high pitched voice upstairs scream. I frowned and walked to the door and asked if everything was alright. “Yea, sure nothing to worry about.” I couldn’t hear everything she said because of the music, but it took quite a while before she was down again. “What’s going?” I asked myself, “I know girls take long in the bathroom, but this.” I raised my shoulders and went back to cooking.
                               </p>
                            <p>
                                I got out the spaghetti I bought, it was fresh made and gauged a big drop of olive oil in to the cooking water on the fire, flopped some fresh spaghetti in the pan and hummed away on the music whilst stirring the sauce. I grabbed a little spoon to taste the sauce and nodded my head. I turned off the heat and made the table ready for dinner. I walked to the stairs and yelled “Dinner has been made come down when you’re ready, okay?” I turned down the music and heard  Mea “I’m coming.” When she was finally in the living room she said “Hmmm smells delicious.” I turned around and said “Yea it’s spaghetti with…” I stopped and dropped the cutlery on the floor. With open mouth I saw her drying her hair with a towel out of the bathroom. It smelled so familiar that I immediately knew what it was, she had been showering with my shampoo and when she was done had gone into my room, had opened the closet and put on my shirt. There she was standing, as nonchalant as it can be, in a way too big of a sweater and super expensive pants drying her hair like she just stepped out her own shower, by a guy who she had just met. My jaw was right open and I just couldn’t get a word out. “Wh- wh-” She replied with the same cat voice to me “Oh yea I used your shower, hope you don’t mind.”
