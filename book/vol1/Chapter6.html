                            I looked at the clock. nine ‘o’clock already. When opening my laptop I tried grasping for my phone “Damn, already forgot” I whispered In myself, ”I’m not used to not having a phone.” I always used to check my phone for any messages almost every half hour. Now that I couldn’t, it felt rather distant to everyone. I opened up my internet browser and browsed to a website where I could watch my daily late night series. But when I started my series I couldn’t get my mind off the conversation with the mysterious person. Halfway through, I stopped the series and decided that my mind was to cluttered to even concentrate. “Alright” I said with full confidence “Here is what I think I know.” I stood up, went into the kitchen and started talking aloud. “I was supposedly a girl so I’m going to assume that that person is a he.” I started walking around in the kitchen, drowned in speculations of my own lie “I almost know for certain that he is a guy, because when I told him that I wasn’t a girl it shock him.” When I came to a conclusion that the mysterious person was a guy, I fell in to even more questions. “Why did he message me? Where did he get my  number? Was it just coincidence?” Finally I was too tired to even think. I went upstairs and got myself ready for a good night sleep so that my first day on school would not be to tiring. I did not even touch the bed or I was already sleeping, which was strange because I hadn’t done anything that wore me out. It was only good that I fell asleep immediately for that the next day would be a rather scary one. It would be the first day of school. The day you get to meet everyone in your class. Not really tiring and usually not longer than a couple of hours. But as the introvert that I is very scary to meet the new people you are going to spend the whole year with. Too bad I wasn’t much of a talker. My plan would consist of being first in class, taking the back seat left and hoping no one would sit next to me, that would avoid from having any social conversations and no one even bat’s an eye to that seat. So usually the first day the teachers always say: “I hope you are comfortable with your seats, because this is how it is going to be for the next couple of months.” And I would be set. So I hoped on doing the same this year.

                            I was standing somewhere on a school yard from a school I had never been. It felt familiar still I had never been there. I was talking to some people and eating my lunch I would’ve made that morning. It was blurry what we talked about and I couldn’t understand a thing. I looked left and saw a group of women talking to each other. One of them looked back and before I realised it the everyone around her was gone. I couldn’t quite make up what it was about her but I immediately felt breathless. She walked my way without a shred of doubt and reached out to me. I tried to speak but every word that came out of my mouth was stuttered. She opened her fist, looked straight at me and asked: “Strawberry?”
