                                I immediately stopped my bike, I stepped off and stood there saying “It’s you”. She screamed back at me whilst she had been fully underwater already “Yea it’s me, now help me out you dummy.” I ran of the hill and jumped in the water without thinking. I grabbed her under her belly and pulled her up from the water. I swam to the shore and grabbed her out.
                                </p>
                            <p>
                                All of the grass surrounded higher than our heads and we were fully soaked, I was laying on the wet grass with her beside. Both of us were to out of breath to say anything to each other. A couple of lung stretches later I regained my breathing control and started to pick myself up. As I stood there I reached out to her, she grabbed my hand firmly and started to pull herself up whilst asking: “What took you so long ,huh?” I wasn’t sure what to say so I just said the obvious “I don’t know.” When she almost stood I felt a hard pull on my arm, she pulled me down and sat on my belly, held my arms down and got close. “Now who are you exactly? Did you intentionally push me in the river!?” I tried not to resist or do anything stupid, although this had never happened before I didn’t quite know what to do. Confused as I was I stuttered “Y- y- y-” “Yes? what?” She said with a confused and mad voice while still sounding all too cute. “Your undershirt is shown.” She slowly looked down, and with big white eyes and a pure red face back up. I had a red face as well, trying hard to not look at her whilst in the corner of my eye I could see her red face almost blowing up. She started hitting me with two fist on my chest saying “I hate you, I hate your face. I hate your brown eyes. Go away.” 
                                </p>
                            <p>
                                After a little while she stopped and crawled up in a ball. I pulled off my blouse and turned it around her. I stood up and set her down with ease. She didn’t weigh much. She buttoned up her blouse and her face immediately sprang back with a smile. With cat eyes she looked at me and said: “For your crimes you have to pay. You shall make me dinner tonight.” I looked back at her with an amazed face. “A second ago she was pale red, now she wanted dinner? A strange girl” I thought to myself whilst shaking my head. “Why are you shaking your head?” She said with a discreet voice. “You do not have a choice. It’s not like I asked.” It wasn’t like I didn’t want the company, in fact I’d love to make dinner for her, more over that she was so easy about this that had me worried. But I thought “what the heck, why shouldn’t I. Be a real gentlemen and make the lady dinner will yea.” So I said “Okay, if you want to.” To which she replied “I don’t want to but you have to pay for what you did. So dinner is an easy way out.” She tried to say it firmly but it came over as a big lie. “No tell me your name.” I totally forgot it again, the big and rather important question. Names. “My name is Ryan.” “Hey Ryan I’m Clary and you’ve made me wet on the first meet” She said with a rather satisfied face like she had been planning on that joke for a while. I replied on an somewhat smaller voice “Actually second meet.” To which she replied sniffling with a big smile
