                                I squinted my eyes from looking in to the sun, still a little dazzled and amazed. I looked droopy at my cat who was trying to play with the string dancing in the warm summer wind. Immediately I sat straight up with a pale white face when I realised that it was already 12 and my school day had already been going for an hour. I jumped out of my bed and pulled a creased blouse from my chair of the day before. Whilst running downstairs I pushed the buttons in to place and adjusted my pants upright. Downstairs pulled on the socks I had laying downstairs and went straight out the door. I looked at my phone which had been sitting in my pants the whole night and mockingly said to myself “Oh yea a dead phone is going to wake you up, don’t worry”. I pulled open the full water bottle on my bike and used half of it to wash off my face, the other half I drank to the last drop. After a quick 20 minutes to school I quickly paced up the stairs to my class room. When I finally arrived at class everyone was already gone. My teacher looked at me and started laughing “As I thought, overslept didn’t you?” To which I replied “Yea I’m sorry.” “Haha don’t worry, you’ve always been such an airhead it didn’t even shocked me when I didn’t see you in class.” My homeroom teacher was a nice man with a straight heart and an iron fist. He was very strict in his rules whilst still being fun in class. Some hated him but I always thought he was nice. He was my math teacher, a young man with lot’s of ambition. Last year he heard that I was going to be in his class and as a good mathematician, or just the best of my class, he got excited. He wasn’t the only one who liked me as a student, I was a good graded and mannered kid so teachers were very fond of me. “It wasn’t really intresting anyways so I’ll not make a note of it.” He said with a nice smile, ”And interesting enough you are not the only one who is late” he said whilst looking behind me. I turned around and saw a girl out of breath looking with hands on hear knees like she could collapse any minute. “I’m sorry sir, the wind, my bike, traffic.” She said with a voice that was trying hard with such little breath. But the teacher interrupted her “Don’t worry, same for you.” “Thank you sir.” She said with a grateful sound. “Are you alright?” I asked her while reaching her my water bottle, “you look a little worn out.” “Yea thanks” she grasped the water bottle out of my hands and drank it empty. “Looks like you both are getting along well” the teacher said, “but I will not let you get off so easily for skipping an official school day so.” We both looked at the teacher shocked “You guys will sit together for this semester right..” He pointed at the last two desks on the left, “there.” My face got pale, “Please sir, you know I’m not good at..” He bluntly interrupted me and said “To bad Ryan, I had actually reserved that seat already for you but you didn’t show up. And she doesn’t have one so now you’ll have to make do.” I turned back to the girl with a upset face expecting her to be mad for setting me up with her, while instead she handed out my water bottle and smiled. “Hii, I’m Melissa” I grabbed the empty bottle and stuttered “I’m Ryan.” “It’s nice to meet you Ryan, I hope you don’t mind the corner seat” “No.” “Good because that’s your seat.” She said firmelay with a nice smile and a high voice to top it off. Melissa was a blond girl, not to small and not to big at all. As a real living women should be she talked quite a lot, and she loved to talk even more with everyone. And that was great because I had talking issue’s. “Okay guys if you don’t mind, I have a big adult teacher appointment to be at. See you two tomorrow.” He said while leaving the room “And be on time!” He screamed down the hallway. Still startled about what just happened I walked out the classroom, Melissa followed me and poked me on the shoulder. “Not really a talker are you?” “No” “Well I’m so it doesn’t really matter. Tell me Ryan, have we met before?” “I don’t think so” “Okay, well I’m looking forward to getting to know you” “Me to” I said ever so slightly in myself, just hard enough that she wouldn’t hear me mumbling. “Did you just say something?” “No.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was a really useless skill, but over the time I learned myself to know exactly how hard I could say something just enough for them not to hear me. I could time it to the second and loudness of each word. Not that this would ever help me, because at an interview saying that your boss is already an asshole in such a way he doesn’t hear it is not really an admirable skill.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Well at least you do talk. It’s a beginning. Well see ya” At that point we’d reach the bike stall and have gone our own wait. The sun was shining and I could see a glimp of Melissa riding away on her bike. I put in my earpieces I got from the dollar store, stepped on my bike and drove away.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On my way I bought some cherry’s by the stall on the sideway off the roadway. I decided to go to one of my best friends just to kill some time and hang out. I decided  , because I had cherries, to go to  Emily I knew her since primary school, we usually hang out randomly and just talk about everything going on in our lives. Well mostly it was her talking and I listening, which I was great at and really didn’t mind. It made me feel relaxed, like nothing was to worry about other than other people’s worries.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               I called her up and she came outside. “He Ryan” she said while still looking at her phone distracted. “He Emily I said back looking at the cows in the grass whilst sitting on a bench. I was distracted to but by the vastness of nature that surrounded our homes both. She lived close to me, just a couple of minutes on the bike and you would be there. “So whatsupp?” I said looking at her. She was still still looking at her phone. “Hey girl, what are you even doing?” “Oh, yea, hey, one of my friends, she just doesn’t want to shut up about this guy.” She said with an annoyed voice, “she doesn’t even know him good enough but still won’t shut up about it. Ugh I can’t stand it, why don’t I have such special encounters.” “How so?” I said whilst chomping down another cherry, “Here have a cherry.” She grabbed a cherry and went on “I just want to have such special moments as her, she goes out one night when because her parents were smoking and immediately found an amazing guy.” “Then what is her so amazing guy” I said mockingly. To which she replied “Black hair, beautiful eyes with shining curiosity or so she said.” “Sounds pretty cool” “Yea, all I’ve got is my 2 dimensional series.” She looked at me “And that.” I tried looking insulted but it was hard when you know each other for that long “Oh because you are the shining diamond.” “Yes I’m glad you noticed” I laughed out loud. She made me do that quite often. Let me be more social and confident, I liked that a lot from hanging out with her. It made me feel at ease because she had already seen everything so it didn’t really matter what I did. “So how is your life” she said interrupting my daydreaming “Oh you know the usual nothingness” “Sounds boring but it’s not like I do so much more” we both giggled at each other from our inside jokes. And for the next hour we joked and laughed at each other’s bad humour and until I said “Okay cherries are done for, I’ll see you later Emily” She replied “See you Ryan.” We both departed our own ways and I could just see her looking at her phone again with an irritated face.
