                                As my jaw made my mouth whole again, I did what any sane guy would do and asked the obvious, “Did you just use my shower?” to which she replied like it was the most normal thing in the world “Yes I did.” I grabbed the cutlery I dropped from the floor, and my mind went wild. What was she doing this easy going? Why the hell would she just do this? She swept the towel around her hair and took a seat at the table, “So chef, what have you cooked for me?” “Uhh,” I stuttered still drowned in thoughts “Spaghetti with meat.” To which she replied mockingly “Wouw how detailed. Well let’s dig in and taste shall we?” I sat down looking at her handling her for and spoon like a royal. She did know how to eat as a royal queen sitting around a grand dining table.</p>
                            <p>
                                After her whole dinner plate was swept clean in the most elegant way she placed her cluttery down and dropped down her chair letting out the faintest of air. “Pheww” she said, “that was delicious.” I grabbed my last bite and went about cleaning the table. After everything was cleaned from the table she stood up and said “I’ll be off then, you’ve repaid your debt to me and I’m satisfied.” She walked out the door and I followed her dropping my drying towel on the floor. She was already out the last gate, when I opened it she jumped me, gave me a kiss on the cheek and whispered: “’till next time, gentleman.” I was shocked and she quickly drove away. I stood still for a couple of minutes seeing her blond hair waving in the wind until she went around the corner not leaving a shred of contact information except her name. I went back inside and picked up my towel, sat on the piano stool and started playing the piano. To my expectation it was quite amazing, for reason I wanted to ignore.</p>
                            <p>
                               After a while I got bored and stopped, it was already seven and I didn’t know what to do. I decided to go and play some video games, but when I got to the stairs the doorbell rang and I immediately stopped and froze. I asked myself who it could be because I wasn’t expecting anyone. Then I remembered that I had ordered a new phone. I opened the door and to my disappointment it was a charity working, “I’m sorry sir, would you have any donations for the animal in Africa?” “No, I’m sorry.” She replied with the slightest judgemental tone “Oh okay, have a nice evening.” I always think the judge me when I don’t give them money, but if I could have given them anything, I wouldn’t be living in my mom’s house. I closed the door but just before the lock could slide out into its place the doorbell rang again. I quickly opened it with big eyes and there was the postman, “Package for Ryan.” He said with a smile, “just sign here please.” I scrabbled some weird R and he gave me the small box. I thanked him and went back inside, plopping down the package on the wooden table I just had been eating on. I opened it and there was a brand new phone. I went upstairs to retrieve my old trashy phone and when I popped out the little phone card I laid the phone in the trash, “That is not usable anymore.” I turned on my phone and followed the quick steps. I installed my most used apps under more the messenger applicate from before. I opened the messenger up and to my amazement I got a bunch of messages from all sorts of people.</p>
