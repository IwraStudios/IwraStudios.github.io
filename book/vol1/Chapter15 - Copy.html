                                School was done and I went up to search for Casper, who would be done with school around the same time, but I got stopped by Melissa. “To be clear about everything, is Clary your girlfriend? Or just a potential?” As a small kid trying to make his point I stood my ground, pulled down both hands and firmly said “She is neither!” Although that had no effect because I was looking at the ground whilst blushing. Clearly Clary did a number on me, as that I could not stop myself from saying <i>no</i> with a straight face. Melissa giggled a little like the innocent young lady she was. I struggled myself loose and went around to where I’d normally meet Casper, which was around the corner near a back ally. “He Casper!” I yelled towards Casper who was on his phone. “Oh, hey Ryan.” He said with the same interested face he always had.
“Let’s go” I said energetically whilst crossing him with my bike.

                                </p>

                                On the way home we talked about the most stupidest stuff and laughed at the inside jokes like we always do. I showed him a picture of a strange symbol my teacher had around his bag, “I’m still looking for this weird thing.”
“Maybe it’s a new gender.” He replied with a stupid voice. The new genders were a stupid trend around that time and we made fun of that. “Whahaha what?” I laughed to which he said mockingly trying to impersonate someone on the internet “there are 75 genders.” I laughed even harder and said “Go home man.”
“Did you just assume my gender!?” He yelled at me from across his bike. I laughed in tears and replied appropriately “Did you just assume!?” but he was prepared and immediately hit me with another comment “Did you just assume <i>my</i> assume!?” We looked at each other dead serious and fell into laughter if not almost from our bikes. Nothing we said to each other really made any sense and we did not care.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After a while we departed our own ways home. I looked at my phone and saw that I had received a message from Melissa.

                                   A couple hours past and the party was going sideways. It was not even that late, rather early for an off-road party. As boring as I was the coke was my only friend past all the people who had no going back from their alcohol shots. Even Melissa was not her usual self, which alcohol tended to do, and she went off dancing like a lunatic on taboo songs other drunk people had put on. Everyone in my class was at this party, even more. As I decided to split the party after my cold cola I went up to the hallways where my jacket was located. I grabbed it opened the door and I immediately got pulled away in to a separate room. Before I had the chance to say anything I got shushed by a mysterious person. “What is going on? Who are you?” It was a little too dark to see. Only a digital clock and the windows light were shining. “Finally a chance. Wow you’re always crowded Ryan.” I looked at the vague silhouette who was holding me down. “Luckily you decided to walk past here without anyone seeing you. Lucky for me.” I heard a cute girly voice say. I try to say “A chance? For wh..” But before I even got any chance I felt the softest lips touch mine. The felt like the softest cloud cushions I had ever felt. I felt a kiss so gently it was like that moment froze in time and I went straight to heaven all in a fraction of a split second. She pulled back and I heard her softly words say “Thank you.” Before I knew what happened I looked at the clock “8:37 again, huh.”
