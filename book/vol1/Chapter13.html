                                I got up from my bed and started my too early morning routine. It started  out with snoozing my phone, which was on my desk to get me up. It shocked me because it had a new sound. When I was there I’d come up with a million excuses to not go to school, and whilst doing that I’d make my way to the shower. After having forced myself into the shower I’d get some clothes and head downstairs. From there on further I had convinced myself to not rob a store just to get out of going to school. Making breakfast wasn’t hard either, consisting off a simple sandwich with Nutella spread over it. Nutella consists of sugar and chocolate and I, around that time, consisted of Nutella and water. If there wasn’t any at home I’d go mental and personally go to the nearest store to buy some. After having pushed that down it was already too late, almost every time, and I’d run out forgetting one or two things.
								</p>
								<p>
                                When I arrived at school, after my morning routine, the first buzzer had already rung. I ran to where I thought would be my first class. Meanwhile I grabbed the paper ball out of my bag which supposedly was my timetable. I opened it up and de deciphered what was written down. “Math class” it read, but where it was it did not say. I stood on top of the stairs looking around me like a caveman searching for his people, but it was futile as that I didn’t know who was in my class.
								</p>
								<p>
                                I must’ve looked hella stupid as that Melissa was downstairs giggling at me behind her books she held up. When I finally noticed her I was lowkey trying to play it off by walking down the stairs, but as lowkey I get I slipped and fell down right next to her flat on my face. She started laughing and I was so embarrassed I just laid there on the floor. After she was done laughing I looked up and saw her wiping her tears away and smiling like the wind. I stood up and picked up my stuff from the floor. She started talking “It is in the other building.” I looked at her questioned and she said while still wiping the tears from the clown show away, “Math class. Come or we’ll be late.” I quickly stepped to her and she continued “”What were you doing? You looked weirdly hilarious.” While looking at the ground I replied “I didn’t know where to go.” To which she said “Well luckily I had an appointment with our homeroom teacher here then.” I said nothing back and we walked to the second building.
								</p>
								<p>
                                When we arrived it was a mess, everyone was standing and talking to each other. I imagined that everyone would be focussed on me because I wasn’t on the first day, but it looked like no one even cared. I sat down on the back of the corner and looked around. A lot of girls around and a couple of boys talking to them. Some were laughing with each other and other were laughing at. I quietly observed from the back what was going on. Melissa was talking to some girls in the back, they looked like they were having fun. Some other girls were laughing at a guy and talking around his back whilst the guy was talking to this other girl, they seemed to have an argument about something but the girl was merely upset rather than angry. The other guys where having a conversation about anything a boy has a conversation about around that age. It was rather a clucking house full of chicken than a classroom. The teacher came in and everyone sat down. “Okay everyone, attention please.” He started writing down his name on the white board. “I’m also your homeroom teacher so behave. That concludes my introduction, open up your books on page 6.” He started writing down a simple formula then looked around. “Can anyone tell me…” He was interrupted by someone who had raised their hand, “What is it Clary?” I shocked out my dream world and looked at my classmate. I sat with open mouth and my jaw dropped down to the floor, “You!?”
